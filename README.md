Created a water tracker using the HTML, CSS, and basics of JavaScript. 

    You can increase the amount of water you've drank and then save.
    Every time you press save, the amount you've chosen is displayed.
    Every time the amount displayed, the total amount is shown below. 
    After it reaches a liter, it's displayed as x L in the total amount section.

My first JS project of hopefully many to come!
